# AVE Clinical Variant Interpretation (CVI) Workstream

The [Atlas of Variant Effects (AVE) Alliance](https://www.varianteffect.org) aims to propel systematic and extensive measurement and analysis of the impact of genetic variants on functional elements of human, model organism and pathogen genomes, to further the understanding of genes, gene products and their regulation and empower the diagnosis and treatment of human disease.

The Clinical Variant Interpretation (CVI) workstream resolves issues relating to the use of MAVE data to interpret human genetic variants. Members of this group:

* Develop approaches for integrating variant effect maps with other sources of information in clinical interpretation
* Establish best practices for evaluating/benchmarking clinical utility of variant effect maps
* Exemplify use of variant effect maps in diagnostic practice

All members are expected to follow the [AVE Code of Conduct](https://www.varianteffect.org/code-of-conduct).

[Meeting minutes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iXnn70Zkt1vR3zp2hINXiVb3amrhC2LwRWwwGqw4bUQ/edit) and [other workstream documents](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12B_o24O1PoBUsTzHsE8708WFk8_Q-Dpb) are hosted in the [AVE Alliance Members Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0AB1IMnWMCvviUk9PVA).
